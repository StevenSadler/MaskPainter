# Mask Painter

## Libraries

Mask Painter uses TKinter, PIL, OpenCV, Numpy, and Pyinstaller.

## Overview

Mask Painter is a tool that provides interaction between a human designer and a procedural content generator.
The GUI is made with TKinter and PIL. The masks are Numpy arrays that are edited with OpenCV draw commands. 
Pyinstaller is used to convert the Python script to an executable file. A designer can use the executable without needing to install Python.

The build scripts and executable are not included in this repo.
